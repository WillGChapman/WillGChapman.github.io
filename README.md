# Will Chapman's web page

I am a data scientist at the Jean Golding Institute (JGI), University of Bristol, specialising in advanced statistical modelling, computational methods, and interdisciplinary research. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches to data analysis and supporting collaborative projects that address real-world challenges.

## About Me

I’m a recovering psychologist turned data wrangler, now working at the Jean Golding Institute. My career has been a journey from poking at brains to poking at spreadsheets. Sometimes with more success than others. I specialise in making sense of messy, complicated data (and occasionally making it messier), especially in healthcare, where the stakes are high and the datasets are even higher. My PhD involved convincing people to reach for things while I tried to figure out what they were thinking—turns out, it’s complicated. I’m passionate about open science, reproducible research, and pretending I understand Bayesian statistics. If you need someone to find patterns in chaos, or just want to talk about the joys and frustrations of big data, I’m your person (or at least, I know where to look).

- **Research Interests:**  
    Data science, machine learning, statistical modelling, interdisciplinary collaboration, and open research.

## Education

- **PhD, University of Bristol**  
    [Embodied Decisions: Linking Perceptual Uncertainty and Reach-to-Grasp Trajectories](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/embodied-decisions). Explored the impact of perceptual uncertainty on reach-to-grasp movements using experimental, statistical, and computational approaches.

- **MSc Neuropsychology, University of Bristol**  
    Postgraduate training in cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuropsychology, and research methods.

- **BSc Psychology (First Class), University of the West of England (UWE)**  
    First class undergraduate degree in Psychology, with a strong foundation in theory, research, and data analysis.
