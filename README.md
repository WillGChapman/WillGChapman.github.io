# Will Chapman's web page

I am a data scientist at the Jean Golding Institute (JGI), University of Bristol, specialising in advanced statistical modelling, computational methods, and interdisciplinary research. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches to data analysis and supporting collaborative projects that address real-world challenges.

## About Me

With a background spanning psychology, neuropsychology, and data science, I specialise in advanced statistical analysis, multilevel and mixture modelling, and computational approaches to complex data. My skillset includes experimental design, parameter estimation, and the application of modern statistical techniques to large and heterogeneous datasets. I am particularly interested in big data challenges, especially those arising in healthcare, where robust modelling and reproducible workflows can drive improvements in research and patient outcomes. I also have a strong interest in probabilistic programming for Bayesian model fitting, leveraging these tools to better capture uncertainty and complexity in data. My PhD explored how perceptual uncertainty influences human actions, using three-dimensional motion tracking and multilevel modelling. I am passionate about reproducible research and open science, and currently contribute to projects improving healthcare data pipelines and other research using large publicly available datasets.
